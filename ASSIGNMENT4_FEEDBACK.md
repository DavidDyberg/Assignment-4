Hi David!

Excellent work, really nice code an it works perfectly!

The only thing left to do is handling any potential errors - I think we covered this in our week 11 lecture - https://changemakereducation.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/FEA22FTSTO-Frontend-programmering/ETTcX3m_xVtBqOEjr9v2VusBHyobAYDzekq30lkzITvISQ?e=2haHzZ

But do that for your own experience & knowledge, there's no need to resubmit.

You've already shown you know what you are doing: VG, very well done!
